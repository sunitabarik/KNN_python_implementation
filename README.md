# KNN_python_implementation
developed KNN model using python’s most popular machine learning package ‘scikit-learn’.
Scikit-learn provides data scientists with various tools for performing machine learning tasks. 
For KNN model, we are going to use the ‘KNeighborsClassifier’ algorithm which is readily available in scikit-learn package. 
evaluated  KNN model predictions using the ‘accuracy score’ function in scikit-learn.
